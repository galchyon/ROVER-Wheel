# ROVER-Wheel

This code was written as a part of german-speaking student project "ROVER". The big aim was to build a robot similar to the NASA-Rover; my task was to write a programm
which helps an user to turn the robot. The wheels are connected with servo motors, so in princip my code turning the servos in given position.

The library contains main code to control the wheels. The programm code was used to control the servos and to print the calculated angles to check the correctness of the algorithm.
